# Vowel-Counter---Python
üìù Description of the Program:
This program counts the number of **vowels** in a word that the user enters. Vowels are the letters **A, E, I, O, and U** (both uppercase and lowercase).

‚öôÔ∏è What It Does:

* It asks the user to type in a word (like "apple" or "education").
* It goes through each letter of the word.
* It checks if the letter is a vowel.
* It keeps track of how many vowels are found.
* It then shows the total number of vowels in the word.

üîç How It Works (Step by Step):

1. User Input:

   * The program starts by asking the user to type in a word.
   * That word is stored in a variable.

2. Vowel Definition:

   * A list of vowels (`a, e, i, o, u` and `A, E, I, O, U`) is defined so the program knows which letters to count.

3. Counting Process:

   * The program looks at each letter in the word, one by one.
   * If a letter is in the list of vowels, it increases the count.

4. Output:

   * After checking all the letters, the program prints the final number of vowels found.

üß™ Example:

If the user types: `Education`

Letters in the word: `E`, `d`, `u`, `c`, `a`, `t`, `i`, `o`, `n`
Vowels found: `E`, `u`, `a`, `i`, `o`
So, the output will be: **Number of vowels: 5**
